To develop a program that accepts a topic as input from the user, searches the internet for information about it, and answers questions related to the topic, we can use the Python programming language along with some popular libraries. In this case, we will use the following libraries:

requests: To send HTTP requests and retrieve web content.
beautifulsoup4: To parse and extract information from HTML.
nltk: To perform natural language processing tasks such as tokenization and stemming.
googlesearch-python: A Python library to perform Google searches.
To install the required libraries, run the following command:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4 nltk googlesearch-python

Instructions to run the code:

Install the required libraries as mentioned above.
Save the code to a file, e.g., topic_search.py.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
Run the code using the command: python topic_search.py.
Enter a topic when prompted. The program will search the internet for information and provide the most relevant answer it finds. Enter 'q' to quit the program.
